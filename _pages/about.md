I'm a first PHD student at the ISIR Lab in Sorbonne University working on Machine Learning-based Precision Medecine tools for Early Detection of Neuro-Developmental Disorders. I graduated from Sorbonne University in 2022 majoring in Robotics and Intelligent Systems. Prior to that, I pursued studies in Electronics & Electrical Engineering at Sorbonne University.

My current research revolves around learning discrete representations of so called *strong modalities* that could serve as grounding modalities in a multimodal framework.

**Main research interests**:
  - Social Robotics / Affective Computing
  - Multimodal Machine Learning
  - Discrete Representation Learning
